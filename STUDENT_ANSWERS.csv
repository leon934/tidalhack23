name,1. What does the first derivative test help determine?,"2. In the first derivative test, a critical point where the derivative changes sign indicates that the function has a __________ at that point.","3. If the first derivative is positive to the left of a critical point and negative to the right, what type of extremum does the function have at that point?",4. How is the critical point related to the first derivative in the first derivative test?,5. The first derivative test is based on analyzing changes in the sign of the first derivative around critical points to determine the __________ of the function.
